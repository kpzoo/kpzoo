### Engineer | Epidemiologist | Researcher | Data Scientist

I'm an MRC career development award fellow (_Imperial College London_) and honorary lecturer (_University of Bristol_) working on translating ideas from engineering and data science into better solutions to problems in infectious diseases. I lead the **EpiEng**(_Epidemiological Engineering_) group.
