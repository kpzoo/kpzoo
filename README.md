### Engineer | Epidemiologist | Researcher | Data Scientist

I'm an MRC career development award fellow (_Imperial College London_) and honorary lecturer (_University of Bristol_) working on translating ideas from engineering and data science into better solutions to infectious disease problems. 

I lead the multidisciplinary **EpiEng** (_Epidemiological Engineering_) group. Our interests include:

1) Real time estimation and tracking of infectious disease dynamics
2) Feedback control laws for efficiently suppressing spread
3)
