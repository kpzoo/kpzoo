### Engineer | Epidemiologist | Data Scientist

I'm an MRC career development award fellow (_Imperial College London_) and honorary lecturer (_University of Bristol_). I lead the multidisciplinary **EpiEng** (_Epidemiological Engineering_) group.

We work on translating ideas from _engineering and statistics_ into better _data-driven solutions to biomedical problems_. 
Our interests sit within two themes:
  
**Minimal modelling**: _minimising model complexity and maximising the information extracted from single and combined data sources_

1) Real-time tracking of infectious diseases from scarce data (optimal filtering and smoothing algorithms)
2) Statistics for disaggregating the influence of data and prior assumptions on posterior estimates (minimum description length)
3) Models for leveraging multiple data types (genetic sequences, cases, wastewater) to improve bias and variance (data fusion)

**Smart modelling**: _succintly modelling coupled or interacting processes to devise more effective data-driven interventions_

1) Statistical decision theory for when to act using data across multiple scales (experimental design)
2) Feedback control laws for efficiently suppressing spreading processes (reinforcement learning)
3) Models of behavioural and other coupled interactions to anticipate changepoints in dynamics (networks and metapopulations)
