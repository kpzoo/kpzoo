### Engineer | Epidemiologist | Researcher | Data Scientist

I'm an MRC career development award fellow (Imperial College London) and honorary lecturer (University of Bristol) working on translating ideas from engineering and data science into better solutions to problems in infectious diseases. I lead the Epidemiological Engineering (**EpiEng**) group.
