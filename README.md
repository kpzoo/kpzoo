### Engineer | Epidemiologist | Data Scientist

I'm an MRC career development award fellow (_Imperial College London_) and honorary lecturer (_University of Bristol_) working on translating ideas from engineering and statistics into better data-driven solutions to infectious disease problems. 

I lead the multidisciplinary **EpiEng** (_Epidemiological Engineering_) group. Our interests sit within two themes:

**Minimal modelling**
We attempt to minimise the complexity of models and maximise the information extracted from single and combined data sources. 
Projects include:
1) Real-time tracking of infectious diseases from scarce data (optimal filtering and smoothing algorithms)
2) Statistics for diagnosing excess model complexity applied to phylogenetics problems (minimum description length)
3) Models for leveraging multiple data types (sequences, cases, wastewater) to improve bias and variance (data fusion)
4) Metrics for disaggregating the influence of data and prior assumptions on posterior estimates (Fisher information)

**Smart modelling**
We aim to model coupled or interacting processes succinctly to devise novel or more efficient data-driven interventions.
Projects include:
1) Statistical decision-making from data across multiple scales
2) Feedback control laws for efficiently suppressing spreading processes
3) Statistical criteria for model selection and interpretability
4) Data fusuon of phylogenetic, case and other surveillance data
